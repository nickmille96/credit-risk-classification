Results:
Accuracy Score: 99%
Precision Score for High Risk Loans: 85%
Precision Score Healthy Loans: 100 %
Recall Score Healthy Loans: 99%
Recall Score High Risk: 91$

Based on the results the model was very accurate at predicting the healthy loans with a 100% precision score however it was not as accurate at predicting loans of higher risk. More testing of the model should be done to provide more accurate results for these higher risk loans. However, I would still recommend this model as its accuracy and recall scores are still high and in the upper 90's in most cases.
